# Machine Learning-Powered Trading Strategy 📈

This project implements and compares two stock trading strategies: a **Manual Strategy** based on technical indicator rules and a **Strategy Learner** that uses machine learning to autonomously develop its own trading policy. The primary goal is to rigorously evaluate the performance of a human-designed approach against an ML-driven one using specific, controlled experimental parameters.

This was developed as the capstone project for the Georgia Tech course, [CS7646: Machine Learning for Trading](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7646-machine-learning-trading).

## Project Overview 💡

The project's core is a head-to-head comparison between human intuition and machine learning in the context of stock trading.

1.  **`ManualStrategy`**: A traditional, rules-based trading algorithm. I defined specific entry and exit signals based on a combination of **[Indicator 1, MACD Histogram ]**, **[Indicator 2, RSI]**, and **[Indicator 3,Percent B (Bollinger Bands)]**. This represents a "human-defined logic" approach, tuned on in-sample data.

2.  **`StrategyLearner`**: A smart agent that uses a **[Ensemble learner(bag learner) with random forest learner (RT learner)]** to learn a trading policy from the same set of indicators. It's trained on an "in-sample" period and then tested "out-of-sample" to evaluate its ability to generalize to new, unseen data.

Two distinct experiments were conducted to compare the strategies and analyze the learner's sensitivity to market conditions.

## Key Features ✨

  * **Dual-Strategy Framework**: Implements both manual and ML-based trading agents for direct, apples-to-apples comparison.
  * **Structured Experimentation**: Features two detailed experiments to compare strategies and analyze the impact of transaction costs.
  * **Modular Codebase**: Reuses learners (`RTLearner`, `BagLearner`, etc.) and modules from previous work in a clean, organized structure.
  * **Rigorous Backtesting**: Adheres to strict in-sample/out-of-sample periods, transaction cost modeling, and benchmark comparison for robust evaluation.

## Performance Highlights 📊

The primary comparison (`Experiment 1`) was conducted on **JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)** stock. The chart below shows the normalized out-of-sample performance of both strategies against the benchmark.

*Out-of-sample portfolio performance for `ManualStrategy`, `StrategyLearner`, and Benchmark.*

The `StrategyLearner` was able to **[briefly describe the outcome, e.g., significantly outperform both the manual strategy and the benchmark, demonstrating its ability to adapt and find profitable patterns]**. Detailed performance metrics (cumulative return, Sharpe ratio, etc.) are generated by the project scripts.

### Experiment 1: Manual vs. Machine Learning Strategy

This experiment directly compares the performance of the `ManualStrategy` against the `StrategyLearner` and the benchmark. The script generates two charts: one for the in-sample period and one for the out-of-sample period, showing the normalized portfolio value of all three. It also produces tables with key performance metrics (cumulative return, mean/STD of daily returns).

### Experiment 2: Analyzing the Effect of Market Impact

This experiment investigates how the `StrategyLearner`'s behavior changes as market impact costs are varied. By running the learner on the in-sample data with different `impact` values (e.g., 0.0, 0.005, 0.02), I analyze how its trading frequency and overall returns are affected. This demonstrates the learner's ability to adapt its policy to changing transaction costs, a crucial feature for real-world application.

## Statistics


* In Table 1:
  In-sample: The manual strategy outperforms the benchmark with higher cumulative and mean daily returns, and lower volatility.
Out-of-sample: Both show negative performance, but the manual strategy declines less, still outperforming the benchmark.<br>

* In Table 2:
  As the impact value increases, returns decrease and volatility increases, confirming the hypothesis that higher impact reduces profit and raises risk.<br>
